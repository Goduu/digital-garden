From the earliest stages of our lives, we're taught to chase after happiness, envisioning a 
life filled with sustained joy and contentment. This pursuit shapes our understanding of 
happiness as something that should flow seamlessly through the tapestry of our lives, 
untouched by the hands of sorrow or interruption. 
According to this perception, the value of our happiness—whether experienced in the past or the 
present—is contingent upon its ability to endure without disruption. 
An interruption, therefore, risks invalidating the very essence of our happiness, 
casting shadows of doubt on the joy we've felt.

This philosophy invites us to question the fragility of happiness. 
Is happiness truly so delicate that a single moment of unhappiness can 
render null the joy that preceded it? Or is this perception a construct, 
a belief that confines us to a relentless pursuit of an unattainable ideal? 

Redefining happiness as a series of moments, rather than a continuous state, 
might offer a more resilient and realistic approach to contentment. 
Recognizing that life's inherent ups and downs do not diminish the validity 
of the happiness we experience allows us to embrace joy in its many forms. 
It acknowledges that happiness, like life itself, is punctuated by moments of 
sadness, growth, and change, each contributing to the richness of our human experience.

When I'm feeling really sad due to an event, certain questions have been significantly helpful:

- Can I do anything to change the situation? If not, I should begin to recover, because if we can't change it, why would being sad help?
- Is the situation as bad as it seems to me right now? Usually, the answer is no. Engulfed in sadness, we often overlook all the good things surrounding us.

Be happy!
