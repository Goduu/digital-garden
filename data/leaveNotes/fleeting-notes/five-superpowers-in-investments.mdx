Investing wisely requires more than just knowledge of the markets; it demands psychological strength and strategic foresight. Here are five superpowers that can significantly enhance your investment journey:

## 1. Low Susceptibility to FOMO
**Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)** can lead investors to make hasty decisions, 
chasing highs and suffering lows. Achieving median returns over an above-median 
time frame can yield extraordinary results, demonstrating that patience often outperforms the fear-driven rush.

## 2. Know the Game You Are Playing
Whether you're in it for the short haul or the long run, understanding your investment timeline is crucial. 
Long-term investors should not be swayed by short-term market fluctuations, focusing instead on the bigger picture.

## 3. Have a Long-Term Horizon
The ability to invest with a 10-20 year perspective is a significant advantage. 
This long-term horizon allows for compound interest to work its magic, turning steady investments into substantial wealth.

## 4. Understand the Difference Between Patience and Stubbornness
Stubbornness involves clinging to failed strategies out of a mistaken belief in their past success. 
In contrast, patience is about allowing sufficient time for your well-considered strategies to bear fruit. 
Recognizing this difference is key to adapting and thriving in the investment world.

## 5. Be Comfortable Being Miserable
Investment can be a rollercoaster, with periods of uncertainty and discomfort. 
Embracing these challenges without panic selling or irrational decision-making can be a superpower in itself, 
allowing you to remain focused on long-term goals despite short-term discomfort.

Mastering these five superpowers can dramatically improve your investment outcomes, fostering resilience, strategic patience, and a focused vision that transcends the daily noise of the market.
