Within End-to-End (E2E) testing, the concept of Time to Live (TTL) plays a crucial role in defining 
the lifespan of test resources, data, or states. TTL dictates how long these elements remain active or 
valid, ensuring that E2E tests are conducted in realistic and controlled conditions.

Implementing TTL in E2E testing involves setting expiration periods for test environments, data, or states 
to ensure they are only available for a necessary duration. This approach facilitates the automatic cleanup 
or reset of these elements post-expiration, thereby preserving the integrity of the testing process and 
preventing any potential contamination of subsequent tests.

For instance, applying a TTL to temporary test data guarantees its availability for the duration of 
the test, after which it is automatically purged. This mechanism not only aids in efficient resource 
management but also in maintaining the accuracy and reliability of E2E tests by eliminating outdated or 
irrelevant data.

In summary, TTL is instrumental in optimizing E2E testing frameworks, making it a key practice for
achieving efficient, accurate, and clean testing outcomes.
