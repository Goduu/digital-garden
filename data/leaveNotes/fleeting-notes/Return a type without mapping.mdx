In TypeScript, managing data transformations while preserving type integrity can be challenging, especially when dealing with operations like sorting an array of objects based on a new property. Consider the case where we have a `User` type and a requirement to sort users by a formatted name. The goal is to perform this operation without remapping the entity or altering the original type, ensuring that the function can return the `User` type while internally using an augmented version of this type for sorting.

Given a user object:

```ts
type User = {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
};
```

And a function to format the user's name:

```ts
const formatUserName = (user: User) => `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`;
```

We aim to sort users by the formatted name without changing the User type. To achieve this, we extend the User type within our sorting function, adding a formattedName property for internal use only. This approach allows us to utilize the formatted name for sorting while maintaining the original user type as the function's return type:

```ts
export function sortUsers<U extends User>(users: U[] | undefined): U[] {
  return [...(users || [])]
    .map(user => ({
      ...user,
      formattedName: formatUserName(user), // Temporarily augment the type with formattedName
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => a.formattedName.localeCompare(b.formattedName))
    .map(({ formattedName, ...rest }) => rest); // Strip the formattedName before returning
}
```

This technique leverages TypeScript's generics and type manipulation capabilities to ensure that:

The input type is respected, allowing the function to accept an array of User or any subtype thereof.
The sorting is performed based on a dynamically calculated property (formattedName) without affecting the original data structure or type.
The returned array maintains the original type, U[], without exposing the internally used formattedName.
By enforcing the function's return type and cleverly manipulating types within the function, we can sort users by a derived property efficiently and safely, showcasing the power and flexibility of TypeScript in handling complex data operations.

This approach optimizes performance and type safety, ensuring that the function remains versatile and reusable without imposing additional runtime costs associated with repeated evaluations or unnecessary type alterations.
