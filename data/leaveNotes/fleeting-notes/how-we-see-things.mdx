The French saying, "Nous ne voyons jamais les choses telles quâ€™elles sont, nous 
les voyons telles que nous sommes," translates to "We never see things as they are; 
we see them as we are." This profound observation touches on the essence of human perception, 
suggesting that our understanding and interpretation of the world around us are deeply influenced 
by our personal experiences, beliefs, and emotions.

Are you seeing the world as it is, or as you are? How can you tell the difference?
