### all()

This returned promise fulfills when all of the input's promises fulfill. If one fails, we don't get any results.

- Good to use when we need the result of EVERY request to proceed.

### allSettled

This returned promise fulfills when all of the input's promises settle (including when an empty iterable is passed), with an array of objects that describe the outcome of each promise.
We all get results, but we need to check if it fails or succeeded.

- Good when we can still proceed with partial results.
