summary: "A comparative overview of `Promise.all()` and `Promise.allSettled()`, highlighting their 
use cases in handling multiple promises in JavaScript asynchronous operations."
---

In JavaScript's asynchronous world, managing multiple promises efficiently is crucial for 
optimizing web application performance and user experience. Two important methods for handling 
collections of promises are `Promise.all()` and `Promise.allSettled()`. Each serves a 
unique purpose in the asynchronous workflow, tailored to different requirements and scenarios.

### `Promise.all()`

`Promise.all()` is a method used when working with multiple promises concurrently. It takes an 
iterable of promises as an input and returns a single Promise that:

- **Fulfills** when all input promises have fulfilled. In this case, the returned promise 
resolves with an array containing the values of the input promises in the same order.
- **Rejects** as soon as one of the input promises rejects. The returned promise is rejected with 
the reason of the first promise that rejects.

**Use Case**: `Promise.all()` is ideal when all asynchronous operations need to succeed for 
the program to proceed. It's commonly used in scenarios where the failure of any single 
operation means the collective task cannot be completed or doesn't make sense to continue.

### `Promise.allSettled()`

Introduced in ES2020, `Promise.allSettled()` differs from `Promise.all()` by how it handles 
the resolution and rejection of input promises. It also takes an iterable of promises but returns a promise that:

- **Always fulfills** after all input promises have settled (either fulfilled or rejected). The 
resolved value is an array of objects, each describing the outcome of each promise with a status of 
either "fulfilled" or "rejected" and a corresponding value or reason.

**Use Case**: `Promise.allSettled()` is useful when you need to perform multiple operations independently 
and want to know the outcome of each, regardless of whether they succeed or fail. This method is suitable 
for scenarios where partial success is acceptable, or you need to perform cleanup or follow-up actions 
based on individual results.

**Comparison**: While `Promise.all()` is strict in requiring all promises to fulfill, `Promise.allSettled()` 
offers a more flexible approach, allowing developers to handle both successes and failures collectively. 
The choice between the two depends on whether the completion of your operation requires all tasks to succeed or 
can tolerate some failures.

Understanding the distinctions and appropriate use cases for `Promise.all()` and `Promise.allSettled()` enables 
developers to write more robust, efficient, and resilient asynchronous code, adeptly managing multiple concurrent 
operations.
