Git provides a robust set of commands for managing and refining your codebase, making collaboration and version control more efficient. Here are some advanced techniques to enhance your Git workflow:

- **Amending Commits**: If you need to modify the most recent commit—whether it's the message or the content—use:
  
```console
  git commit --amend
```
This command allows you to adjust the last commit without creating a new one.

- **Fixup Commits for PR Reviews**: For a cleaner PR review process, you can add a commit that specifically addresses changes needed from a previous commit using:

```console
git commit --fixup HASH
```

Replace HASH with the commit ID you're correcting. This helps in organizing and consolidating changes during reviews.

- ***Rebasing with Autosquash***: To integrate and clean up your commit history, especially before merging a feature branch back to the main branch, use:

```console
git rebase --autosquash -i main
````

This command rebases your current branch onto main, automatically squashing commits marked as fixups.

- ***Safe Force Pushing with --force-with-lease***: When you need to force push but want to ensure you're not overwriting others' work, this option offers a safer alternative:

```console
--force-with-lease
```

It checks that the remote branch hasn't been updated before pushing your changes, reducing the risk of disrupting the work of others.

These commands are invaluable for maintaining a clean and efficient Git repository, ensuring that your project's history is both manageable and understandable.
