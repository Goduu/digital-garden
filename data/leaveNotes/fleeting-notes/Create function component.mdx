In modern React development, functional components have become the standard for creating
 reusable and efficient UI components due to their simplicity and access to hooks.
 A popular way to quickly scaffold a React functional component is by using the `rfce` shortcut, 
  provided by various code editors and extensions like ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets.

When you type `rfce` in a JavaScript or JSX file in an editor that supports this snippet, 
it automatically expands to a boilerplate for a React functional component. 
Here's what the expanded code typically looks like:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function ComponentName() {
  return <div></div>;
}

export default ComponentName;
```

This boilerplate provides the basic structure for a functional component, including 
the import statement for React, the component function itself, and the export statement. 
Developers can then immediately start adding logic, state, props, and JSX to the component.

Using shortcuts like rfce not only saves time but also encourages consistency in component 
structure across a project, enhancing readability and maintainability of the codebase.

To utilize this shortcut, ensure your development environment is set up with the 
appropriate plugins or extensions that support React snippets. 
This small efficiency can significantly speed up the process of creating new components 
in your React applications.
