In the context of End-to-End (E2E) development tests, TTL typically stands for "Time to Live."

Time to Live (TTL) is a concept used to determine how long a resource or piece of data should remain valid or available. In E2E tests, TTL can refer to the duration for which a particular test environment, test data, or test state should be considered valid and usable before it needs to be refreshed, reset, or recreated. It helps ensure that the tests are conducted under realistic conditions and that any temporary resources or states do not persist longer than necessary.

For example, if an E2E test involves working with temporary test data or configurations, specifying a TTL can help ensure that this data is only available for a specified amount of time, after which it is automatically cleaned up or reset to maintain test integrity and avoid interference with subsequent tests.
