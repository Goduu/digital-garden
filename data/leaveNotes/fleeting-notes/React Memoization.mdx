Memoization in React is a performance optimization technique that prevents unnecessary re-renders 
by comparing current props or state with the next ones. However, React's memoization doesn't cache 
all previously computed values like traditional memoization. Instead, it focuses on comparing the 
last values with new ones to determine if a re-render is necessary.

- **React.memo()**: It is used for component memoization, comparing incoming props with previous ones. 
`React.memo()` only does a shallow comparison, making it suitable for primitive props but less effective 
for objects or arrays unless additional comparison logic is implemented.

- **useMemo**: This hook is designed for memoizing expensive calculations or values. 
It compares dependencies across renders, and if they haven't changed, it skips recalculating 
the value and uses the memoized result.

### When to use useMemo

- **Avoid with Primitive Values**: Primitive values like strings, numbers, or booleans are efficiently compared by React, making `useMemo` unnecessary for simple calculations based on these types.

    ```ts
    const value = useMemo(() => number1 + number2, [number1, number2]);
    ```

- **Effective for Arrays and Objects**: Use `useMemo` for operations that return new arrays or objects to ensure referential equality between renders. This is crucial for optimizing performance when dealing with complex data structures or expensive computations.

    ```ts
    const value = useMemo(() => numbers.reduce((acc, number) => acc + number, 0), [numbers]);
    const multipliedValues = useMemo(() => numbers.map((value) => value * 100), [numbers]);
    const person = useMemo(() => ({ first, last, full: `${first} ${last}` }), [first, last]);
    ```

## useCallback

- **useCallback**: Similar to `useMemo`, but specifically for memoizing functions. 
`useCallback` ensures that a function's reference remains constant between renders unless 
its dependencies change. This is particularly useful for passing callbacks to optimized child 
components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.

React's memoization tools, when used appropriately, can significantly enhance your application's 
performance by reducing the number of re-renders. Understanding when and how to apply `React.memo()`, 
`useMemo`, and `useCallback` is key to leveraging React's re-render optimization capabilities effectively.
