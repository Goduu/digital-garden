In the realm of investment, risk is an omnipresent companion, subtly weaving through every decision and strategy. 
Carl Richards, a keen observer of financial behavior, offers a profound definition that encapsulates the essence 
of risk with remarkable clarity:

landscape that requires respect and understanding.

lies in our ability to anticipate the unanticipated, 
to prepare for the inevitable surprises that lie beyond the horizon of our foresight.
