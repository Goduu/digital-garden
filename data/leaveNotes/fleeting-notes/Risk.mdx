summary: "Exploring the nuanced understanding of risk in investment as articulated by Carl Richards: the unforeseen that remains after exhaustive planning."

In the realm of investment, risk is an omnipresent companion, subtly weaving through every decision and strategy. 
Carl Richards, a keen observer of financial behavior, offers a profound definition that encapsulates the essence 
of risk with remarkable clarity:

<cite>"Risk is what is left over when you think you have thought of everything."</cite>
- Carl Richards

This statement invites us to reconsider our approach to risk management. It suggests that no matter how comprehensive our 
planning or how sophisticated our strategies, there will always be elements beyond our anticipation or control. 
Risk, in this light, is not merely a factor to be calculated or mitigated but a fundamental aspect of the investment 
landscape that requires respect and understanding.

Carl Richards' definition of risk serves as a reminder that in the intricate dance of investment, our greatest strength 
lies in our ability to anticipate the unanticipated, 
to prepare for the inevitable surprises that lie beyond the horizon of our foresight.

planned and designed, with careful consideration given to every possible scenario, but upon starting the 
implementation, you discovered numerous aspects that had not been previously anticipated?
